## üöÄ Execution Strategy

1. **Sequential Batch Execution**: Complete each batch fully before moving to the next
2. **Testing at Each Stage**: Validate functionality before proceeding
3. **Rollback Plan**: Maintain git branches for each batch for easy rollback
4. **Documentation**: Update README and documentation as features are implemented
5. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring at each stage

This plan ensures a systematic approach to building a complete, production-ready educational platform with all the features outlined in the README and proper Azure deployment infrastructure.
