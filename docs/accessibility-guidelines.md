# Accessibility Guidelines

## Overview

Play & Learn Spark is committed to providing an inclusive learning experience for all children, including those with disabilities. Our application follows WCAG 2.1 AA standards and implements comprehensive accessibility features.

## üéØ Accessibility Standards

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

Our implementation addresses the four main principles of accessibility:

1. **Perceivable:** Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive
2. **Operable:** Interface components must be operable by all users
3. **Understandable:** Information and UI operation must be understandable
4. **Robust:** Content must be robust enough for various assistive technologies

### Target Compliance Levels
- **WCAG 2.1 AA:** Full compliance
- **Section 508:** Compliant
- **EN 301 549:** Compliant
- **ADA:** Compliant

## ‚ôø Implemented Features

### Keyboard Navigation

**Full keyboard accessibility:**
- Tab navigation through all interactive elements
- Arrow key navigation within component groups
- Enter/Space activation for buttons and controls
- Escape key to close modals and return focus
- Home/End keys for group navigation

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- `Alt + S`: Skip to main content
- `Tab`: Move to next focusable element
- `Shift + Tab`: Move to previous focusable element

- Progress updates
- Error messages
- Navigation changes
- Achievement unlocks

### Visual Accessibility

**High Contrast Support:**
- Automatic detection of user preferences
- Enhanced contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- Clear visual focus indicators
- Color-independent information conveyance

**Motion Preferences:**
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` settings
- Optional animation disable
- Smooth vs. instant transitions
- Reduced parallax and complex animations

### Focus Management

**Comprehensive focus handling:**
- Visible focus indicators on all interactive elements
- Focus trap in modals and dialogs
- Focus restoration after modal close
- Skip links for main content access
- Logical tab order throughout the application

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### AccessibilityService

Central service managing accessibility features:

```typescript
import { accessibilityService } from '@/services/AccessibilityService';

// Initialize service
accessibilityService.initialize();

// Announce to screen readers
accessibilityService.announce('Activity completed!', 'polite');

// Register navigation items
accessibilityService.registerNavigationItem({
  id: 'activity-1',
  element: buttonElement,
  priority: 1,
  group: 'activities'
});
```

### useAccessibility Hook

React hook for component accessibility:

```typescript
import { useAccessibility } from '@/hooks/useAccessibility';

const { elementRef, announce, focus } = useAccessibility({
  ariaLabel: 'Number Garden Activity',
  ariaDescription: 'Learn counting with interactive garden',
  navigationGroup: 'activities',
  keyboardActivatable: true
});

// Use in component
<button ref={elementRef} onClick={handleClick}>
  Start Activity
</button>
```

### ARIA Labels and Descriptions

Comprehensive labeling system:

```tsx
// Activity buttons
<button
  aria-label="Animal Safari - Learn about animals"
  aria-describedby="safari-description"
  data-nav-group="activities"
>
  Animal Safari
</button>

<div id="safari-description" className="sr-only">
  Interactive activity to learn about different animals and their sounds
</div>
```

## üé® Visual Design Guidelines

### Color and Contrast

**Requirements:**
- **Normal text:** 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum
- **Large text:** 3:1 contrast ratio minimum
- **UI components:** 3:1 contrast ratio minimum
- **Focus indicators:** 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colors

**Implementation:**
```css
/* High contrast mode support */
.high-contrast {
  filter: contrast(150%);
}

/* Focus indicators */
.focus-visible\:ring-accessibility:focus-visible {
  @apply ring-2 ring-primary ring-offset-2;
}
```

### Typography

**Accessible font choices:**
- Primary: Comic Neue (dyslexia-friendly)
- Secondary: Fredoka One (high readability)
- Fallback: System fonts

**Text sizing:**
- Minimum 16px for body text
- Scalable up to 200% without horizontal scrolling
- Clear line height (1.5 minimum)

### Interactive Elements

**Button design:**
- Minimum 44x44px touch target
- Clear visual boundaries
- Descriptive labels (not just "Click here")
- Loading and disabled states

**Form elements:**
- Associated labels with form controls
- Error messages linked via aria-describedby
- Required field indicators
- Clear validation feedback

## üîß Testing Guidelines

### Automated Testing

**Tools and methods:**
- axe-core for automated accessibility testing
- WAVE browser extension
- Lighthouse accessibility audit
- Color contrast analyzers

**Testing checklist:**
- [ ] All images have alt text
- [ ] Forms have proper labels
- [ ] Headings are in logical order
- [ ] Color contrast meets requirements
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] ARIA attributes are correct

### Manual Testing

**Keyboard testing:**
1. Unplug mouse/disable trackpad
2. Navigate using only keyboard
3. Verify all functionality is accessible
4. Check focus indicators are visible
5. Test modal and dialog interactions

**Screen reader testing:**
1. Test with NVDA (free)
2. Test with JAWS (if available)
3. Test with VoiceOver (Mac)
4. Verify announcements are clear
5. Check reading order is logical

### User Testing

**Inclusive testing approach:**
- Include users with disabilities
- Test with actual assistive technologies
- Gather feedback on usability
- Iterate based on real user needs
