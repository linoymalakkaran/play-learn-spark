# Hidden Features - Play & Learn Spark

This document tracks features that have been temporarily hidden to simplify the user experience for children. These can be re-enabled later if needed for advanced users or administrators.

## Dashboard Features (Hidden)

### Content Management System
- **File**: `src/components/ContentManagementSystem`
- **Purpose**: Advanced content creation and editing
- **Why Hidden**: Too complex for children, not essential for learning activities
- **To Re-enable**: Uncomment the ContentManagementSystem dialog in Dashboard.tsx

### Personalization Center
- **File**: `src/components/PersonalizationCenter`
- **Purpose**: Advanced user profile customization
- **Why Hidden**: Student setup now handles basic personalization needs
- **To Re-enable**: Uncomment the PersonalizationCenter dialog in Dashboard.tsx

### Adaptive Content Engine
- **File**: `src/components/AdaptiveContentEngine`
- **Purpose**: AI-powered content adaptation
- **Why Hidden**: Complex feature that may not be fully implemented
- **To Re-enable**: Uncomment the AdaptiveContentEngine dialog in Dashboard.tsx

### Navigation Favorites
- **File**: `src/components/navigation/NavigationFavorites`
- **Purpose**: Save and organize favorite activities
- **Why Hidden**: Children can access activities directly without complex organization
- **To Re-enable**: Uncomment the NavigationFavorites dialog in Dashboard.tsx

### Advanced Search
- **File**: `src/components/navigation/AdvancedSearch`
- **Purpose**: Complex search and filtering options
- **Why Hidden**: Simple category tabs are more intuitive for children
- **To Re-enable**: Uncomment the AdvancedSearch dialog in Dashboard.tsx

### Personalized Navigation
- **File**: `src/components/PersonalizedNavigation`
- **Purpose**: AI-powered navigation suggestions
- **Why Hidden**: May not be fully implemented, sticky menu provides simple navigation
- **To Re-enable**: Add back to Dashboard imports and usage

## Performance & Analytics Features (Hidden)

### Performance Dashboard
- **File**: `src/components/development/PerformanceDashboard`
- **Purpose**: Development and performance monitoring
- **Why Hidden**: Developer tool, not needed for children
- **Status**: Still imported but not displayed

### Accessibility Tester
- **File**: `src/components/accessibility/AccessibilityTester`

## Sound System (Simplified)

### Original Sound System
- **File**: `src/utils/sounds.ts` (replaced)

- **Current**: Simple sound system with essential feedback sounds only

## State Management (Simplified)

### Complex Navigation Store
- **Purpose**: Advanced navigation analytics and state
- **Why Simplified**: Reduced to essential navigation only
- **Current**: Basic navigation with student context

## Future Considerations

### Parent/Teacher Dashboard
- Could include hidden features for advanced management

- Content customization options
- Learning path management

### Administrator Panel
- Content management and creation tools

- System configuration options

## Re-enabling Features

To re-enable any hidden feature:

1. **Uncomment imports** in the relevant files

3. **Add back state management** if needed
4. **Test thoroughly** to ensure functionality
5. **Update this document** to reflect changes

## Notes

- All hidden features are preserved in the codebase
- Core learning functionality remains intact
