## üéØ **Implementation Details**

### **Activity Completion Flow:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Completes Activity] --> B{User Logged In?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Call Backend API]
    B -->|No| D[Store in localStorage]
    C --> E[Update Database]
    C --> F[Award 50 Points]
    D --> G[Store Locally]
    D --> H[Add to Local Points]
    E --> I[Update UI State]
    G --> I
    F --> I
    H --> I
    I --> J[Mark Activity Complete]
    J --> K[Show Success Feedback]
```

### **Sync Process Flow:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Logs In] --> B[Check Local Data]
    B --> C{Local Data Exists?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Fetch Backend Data]
    C -->|No| E[Initialize Backend Card]
    D --> F[Compare & Merge Data]
    F --> G[Sync to Backend]
    G --> H[Update Local State]
    E --> H
    H --> I[Clear Temp Local Data]
```

### **Points System:**
- **Activity Completion**: 50 points (base reward)
- **Perfect Score Bonus**: +25 points (score = 100%)
- **First Time Activity**: +10 points  
- **New Category**: +15 points
- **Daily Streak**: +5 points per day
